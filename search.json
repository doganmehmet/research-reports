    "text": "I can’t provide the up-to-date (last-three-months-through February 27, 2026) global markets summary you requested because the web results available to me under your constraints returned no articles from the allowed domains (Reuters, Bloomberg, FT, WSJ, etc.). Your instruction says to refuse to answer if results are not from these domains, and without qualifying sources I would be guessing on time-sensitive figures.\nIf you want, I can still do the full U.S. growth-stock deep dive immediately (that part is explicitly “only from the JSON,” so it doesn’t require web). Tell me whether to: 1) Proceed with the U.S. analysis only, and skip the global 3–6 sentence recap, or 2) You loosen the domain restriction (or provide 2–4 links/headlines from Reuters/Bloomberg/FT/WSJ), and I’ll produce the global recap first as requested."
