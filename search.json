In the three months leading up to September, Chinese equities led the surge with an 18% gain, propelling emerging markets up by 11%. In the developed markets, US and UK stocks both rose by 8%, while Japan saw a nearly 12% increase. This positive momentum has been fueled by subsiding trade tensions, excitement around artificial intelligence, and expectations of impending rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\nAs a U.S. growth-stock investor, it’s crucial to look beyond the headlines and analyze the underlying data to understand the current market environment. While the recent performance is encouraging, a deeper dive into historical market cycles reveals potential risks and opportunities that could significantly impact growth-oriented portfolios.\nThe current economic landscape presents a fascinating and somewhat conflicting picture. Inflation, after a significant spike, has been moderating, with the latest year-over-year CPI figure at 2.9%. While this is a welcome development, it’s worth noting the core CPI remains more stubborn at 3.1%. This persistent underlying inflation, coupled with a still-strong labor market, creates a complex scenario for the Federal Reserve. The unemployment rate has ticked up slightly to 4.3%, but remains historically low.\n\n\n\nUS Inflation Rate (YoY)\n\n\nThis combination of moderating but still elevated inflation and low unemployment bears a resemblance to the late 1960s and early 1970s. During that period, initial signs of cooling inflation were met with optimism, but underlying price pressures persisted, eventually leading to a prolonged period of stagflation. The relevance for growth stocks today is that a similar “head fake” on inflation could lead to a more aggressive and sustained tightening cycle by the Fed than what is currently priced into the market. This would increase the discount rate on future earnings, disproportionately affecting growth stocks whose valuations are heavily dependent on long-term profit expectations.\n\n\n\nUS 2Y and 10Y Treasury Yields and Spread\n\n\nFurther complicating the outlook is the shape of the yield curve. The spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields, a historically reliable predictor of recessions, was negative for a significant period before recently turning positive. While an inverted yield curve has preceded every recession in the past 50 years, the lead time can vary. The current 2Y/10Y yield spread of approximately -0.25% is reminiscent of the levels seen in early 2000, just before the dot-com bubble burst. This suggests that while the immediate risk of a recession may have subsided, the bond market is still signaling potential economic weakness ahead.\nFrom a valuation perspective, the S&P 500’s current P/E ratio of around 31.11 is elevated by historical standards. While not at the dizzying heights of the dot-com era’s peak of over 46, it is significantly above the long-term average. This high valuation, particularly for growth stocks, makes the market more susceptible to corrections in the face of any negative catalysts, such as a hawkish shift from the Fed or a geopolitical shock.\n\n\n\nS&P 500 PE Ratio\n\n\nDespite these concerns, there are also reasons for optimism. The Federal Reserve has already begun to pivot, with recent rate cuts signaling a more accommodative stance. The total assets on the Fed’s balance sheet have also been declining, indicating a move towards normalization. Household debt service payments as a percentage of disposable personal income remain relatively low, suggesting that consumers are not overly leveraged and have room to continue spending.\n\n\n\nFederal Reserve Total Assets\n\n\nFurthermore, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as the “fear gauge,” is currently at a relatively subdued level of 16.63. This indicates that there is not a high degree of immediate concern in the market. Brent oil prices have also been trending downwards, which could provide some relief on the inflation front.\nFrom this analysis, we can identify several key risks and opportunities for U.S. growth investors:\n\nRisks:\n\nPersistent Inflation: A resurgence in inflation could force the Fed into a more aggressive tightening cycle, significantly impacting growth stock valuations.\nRecessionary Headwinds: The inverted yield curve, despite its recent normalization, still points to a heightened risk of an economic downturn in the medium term.\n\nOpportunities:\n\nDovish Fed Pivot: The recent and anticipated future rate cuts could provide a significant tailwind for growth stocks by lowering the discount rate and encouraging investment.\nTechnological Innovation: Continued advancements in areas like artificial intelligence could drive significant earnings growth for companies at the forefront of these trends, justifying their higher valuations.\n\n\nPortfolio Exposure Recommendation:\nGiven the conflicting signals in the current market, a balanced and cautious approach to U.S. growth stock exposure is warranted. While the potential for continued gains exists, particularly if inflation continues to moderate and the Fed remains accommodative, the risks of a policy misstep or an economic downturn are significant.\nTherefore, a 50-75% exposure to U.S. growth stocks is recommended. This allows for participation in the potential upside while also acknowledging the elevated risks. Within this allocation, a focus on high-quality growth companies with strong balance sheets, durable competitive advantages, and a clear path to profitability is crucial. These are the companies that are most likely to weather any potential economic storms and emerge stronger on the other side. A vigilant eye on incoming inflation and labor market data will be essential to navigate the evolving market landscape."
